    <h1>Public University Athletic Spending</h1>

  <div class="nutgraf">
    Athletic spending across public universities has gone drastically up since the turn of the century. Operating expenses among major powers like Alabama, Ohio St., and Texas can reach as high as $200 million by 2023, according to Syracuse Sport Management Professor Dr. Gina Pauline. However, do these schools actually generate profit?

      <p>
        
        There are 99 Division-I public universities. Over half of them operated at either a net-zero, or at a net-negative in 2020-21. On average, that means athletics are actually hurting the schools more than they’re actually helping. However, that’s just a face-value perspective. The pandemic slammed institutions like Ohio St. which only <a href="https://buckeyeswire.usatoday.com/2022/02/01/ohio-state-athletics-reports-63-6-million-deficit-for-2020-2021/">generated around $7,000</a> worth in football ticket sales in 2021. For reference, that number was nearly $66 million in 2019.

          However, awareness isn’t being talked about enough that comes from having an athletic program, and can especially apply to a program like Ohio St. which tends to have tremendous success with most, if not all, of its sports. The more awareness, Dr. Pauline said, can lead to more students applying. This means the college can still profit, just in a slightly unconventional way. However, not every college has the sports pristine like the Buckeyes. For example, the University of Connecticut lost nearly $2.4 million, and as a result the institution cut its <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/uconn/article/UConn-proposes-cutting-men-s-tennis-swimming-15363008.php">  men’s tennis, swimming and diving, cross country, and women’s rowing programs</a>.

        </p>

        <p>
          “While this is a painful decision, it is in the best interest of the long-term viability of UConn and UConn athletics,” said UConn President Thomas. 
        </p>

        <p>
          College sports also operate with a completely different mindset compared to professional. In pro sports, there’s an owner and while he/she most likely wants to win, they’re also trying to profit by controlling costs as much as possible. However, colleges tend to operate with the mindset of staying competitive. When revenue goes up, their expenses usually increase as well. In the pros, that’s not necessarily the case.

      Does Spending Equal Success?
    </p>

    <p class="SecondP-Text">

      <p> The short answer is yes, and it’s not that surprising, according to Professor Pauline. The more money a program spends on a given sport, the more games it’ll tend to win. This is because the colleges that spend the most money are able to build nicer facilities. Building better and more advanced facilities usually makes the school more desirable and thus it attracts better high school recruits.</p>

      <p>But, it goes much deeper because the team’s conference plays a massive part in success as well. Using Division-I football from 2020, can help further understand this phenomenon of spending vs. success. That year, the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) spent over $30 million more than Central Michigan, yet both won exactly 50% of their games. Why? Ole Miss plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) which is widely regarded as the best conference in college football due to the amount of talent it sends to the <a href="https://collegefootballnews.com/2021/05/nfl-draft-rankings-by-conference-last-5-years-2021-cfn-program-analysis"> NFL</a>. Meanwhile, Central Michigan is in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) which sends almost nobody to the next level.</p>

      <p>The principle still stands though despite the obvious flaws. Dr. Pauline pointed out that schools inside one of the Power-Five conferences (SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and the Pac-12) are essentially required to maximize their budgets otherwise they won’t be allowed to stay. These are the athletic conferences that make the most money on any given year. If a school decides not to spend and is kicked out, they not only lose recognition, but also the money that’s split to every team within the conference at the end of each season. </p>

      Future of College Sports Spending

      <p>

        Now that the majority of colleges have recovered from the side-effects of COVID-19, spending within their athletic programs are expected to rise dramatically, especially among the Power-Five conferences. With the institution of the NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) players are now able to capitalize on their value which is forcing schools to increase their expenses. However, not every player has the same value as the ones that particularly play Division-I football are far more likely to receive a  <a href="https://swimswam.com/an-early-look-at-which-college-athletes-are-getting-nil-deals/">deal(s)</a>. College athletic spending is already extremely unbalanced, and with the NIL, this is expected to continue, according to Professor Pauline.
        
      </p> 

      <p>
        
        There’s growing concern that the competitive balance of college sports will also continue to exist. Potential solutions include installing a salary cap floor and ceiling. This would be <a href="https://footballscoop.com/news/bob-bowlsby-coaches-salary-cap">extremely difficult</a> to implement though as there are legal challenges, different conferences and sports, and different types of institutions (i.e. public vs. private). One feasible, but unlikely, scenario could be a college wide conference realignment. It’s not a secret that the Power-Five garners the most media attention and sponsorship deals. There are ten FBS conferences with 130 schools total. If that shrinks to five conferences, but the number of schools doesn't change, it could encourage smaller schools to spend more.

      </p>

      <p>
        
        All in all, expect spending to continue to increase among the big schools and in the revenue sports. However, the NIL has created an issue in which spending among the non-revenue sports could decrease as well as create further competitive balance issues.
